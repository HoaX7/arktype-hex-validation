# Task 3: Something Real - Assigment

This project is forked from ArkType: https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/tree/main

### Objective: Modify ArkType to add a string.hex validator.
- Goal: Currently, ArkType has a `string.base64` validator, but no `string.hex` validator. Implement and integrate this new validator.
- Skills Tested: TypeScript, open-source contribution, validation logic, and framework modification.

### Work done
- I forked the main branch of ArkType to implement the `string.hex` validator.
- File changes made can be found in this commit: https://github.com/HoaX7/arktype-hex-validation/commit/aa577c102806e1ed4a5d85efa94934289483756e
